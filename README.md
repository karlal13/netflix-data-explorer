# netflix-data-explorer
A beginner-friendly SQL and statistics project exploring Netflix viewing trends. I'm learning as I go, bear with me. 
## Day 1: Setup & Exploration
Today I created my GitHub repository and uploaded the Netflix dataset. I explored the columns and started thinking about questions I want to answer using SQL. 
### Questions I'm curious about:
-What genres are most popular on Netflix?
-How has Netflix's content evolved over time?
-How does the quantity of content other countries produce compare to the United States?
-What else can I pull from kaggle to explore Netflix analytics?
-What ratings are most popular on Netflix?
-Does the rating impact viewership? If so, to what extent?

Next up: setting up my SQL environment and writing my first queries. 

## Day 2: First SQL Queries

Today I wrote my first SQL queries to explore the Netflix dataset. I learned how to:
-Count rows using 'COUNT(x)'
-Group data using 'GROUP BY'
-Sort results with 'ORDER BY'
-Limit output with 'Limit'
I had some issues with connecting to mySQL, but I worked through them and feel more confident with connecting.
###Insights:
-Netflix has over 8000 titles, but only 100 were counted in the CSV file. I'll have to troubleshoot this tomorrow. 

Next up: more troubleshooting and exploring country trends and time-based patterns.
