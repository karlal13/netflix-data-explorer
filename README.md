# netflix-data-explorer
A beginner-friendly SQL and statistics project exploring Netflix viewing trends. I'm learning as I go, bear with me. 
## Day 1: Setup & Exploration
Today I created my GitHub repository and uploaded the Netflix dataset. I explored the columns and started thinking about questions I want to answer using SQL. 
### Questions I'm curious about:
-What genres are most popular on Netflix?
-How has Netflix's content evolved over time?
-How does the quantity of content other countries produce compare to the United States?
-What else can I pull from kaggle to explore Netflix analytics?
-What ratings are most popular on Netflix?
-Does the rating impact viewership? If so, to what extent?

Next up: setting up my SQL environment and writing my first queries.
